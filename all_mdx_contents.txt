Adrian Tchaikovsky's "Children of Time" isn't just another sci-fi book. It's a deep dive into evolution, AI, and what it means to be alive. Won the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 2016, and for good reason.

Here's the deal: We've got a terraformed planet, genetically modified spiders (yeah, spiders), and an AI running the show based on a human's brain. Sounds crazy? It is, but it's brilliantly executed.

The book flips between spiders evolving into a society (think about that for a second) and humans looking for a new crib in the galaxy. It’s about intelligence—what it looks like across species—and the moral gymnastics of playing god.

Tchaikovsky nails it with the spider civilization. It's alien, sure, but damn if you don't start rooting for them. The storytelling’s tight, cutting between our future and theirs, making you question who’s more humane.

What's really killer here is the dual perspective. It's not just humans vs. spiders; it's a mirror reflecting our own societal and evolutionary quirks. Makes you think, doesn’t it?

"Children of Time" is a sharp look at evolution's wild possibilities, wrapped in a narrative that punches above its weight in sci-fi. With a cover that’s as dark and intriguing as space itself, it's a solid 8/10. A must-read if you’re into evolution, AI, or just good ol’ thinking.

An interesting new theory for thinking about how brain systems operate at a high-level. Hawkins argues for the significance of independent cortical-columns in the brain as individual functional units to synthesize information.

The theory seems plausible but unlikely to capture the full picture, which can describe most theories.

I wish the book went into more technical detail on the theory itself and it's implications, but instead only the first third of the book is dedicated to it.

The next two-thirds of the book are Hawkins talking about his theories on AI and the future of humanity, which are unrelated and also a bit incongruous.

Cixin Liu's "The Three-Body Problem" isn’t just sci-fi; it’s a brain-bending mix of history, science, and first contact, all rolled into one. Ken Liu's translation nails it, making complex concepts and a foreign setting accessible.

The story kicks off during China's Cultural Revolution, showing us how Ye Wenjie sees her world and family torn apart. Fast forward, and she's inadvertently inviting an alien race, the Trisolarans, to Earth. These aliens come from a planet with three suns, which means life there is anything but stable. 

Liu isn't just spinning a yarn about aliens. He’s talking about survival in chaos, the lengths societies go to endure, and what happens when humanity realizes it's not alone—or even top dog. The Trisolarans are a mirror, showing us the best and worst of human nature.

Yeah, the science is tight—Liu doesn’t skimp on the physics or the big questions about the universe. But it’s the human story that grabs you. Ye Wenjie's journey from loss to radical action is the heart of this tale, set against humanity’s own existential crisis.

This book is a thinker. It asks big questions: Can humanity get its act together? What does it mean to be civilized? It’s ambitious, blending real science with speculative fiction, and it doesn’t shy away from the dark side of human nature.

Ken Liu’s translation is key, bridging cultural gaps and making the story resonate no matter where you're from. Plus, the footnotes are gold, offering insights into the Chinese context of the story.

With a cool cover and a story that spans the cosmos, "The Three-Body Problem" is a solid 7/10. It’s dense, sure, but stick with it. This book’s got something to say about where we’re headed, and it’s worth listening.

Charlie Kaufman's debut novel, "Antkind," presents a sprawling narrative that is both hilariously surreal and deeply introspective. This novel encapsulates the signature quirkiness and existential rumination that fans of Kaufman's films like "Being John Malkovich" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" have come to expect. With a hefty page count of 720, the story is a maximalist exploration of identity, memory, and the very fabric of reality.

The protagonist, B. Rosenberger Rosenberg, is a neurotic and underappreciated film critic who stumbles upon a potentially earth-shattering three-month-long stop-motion film created by Ingo Cutbirth. The film, which is later lost to a tragic fire, sends B. on a madcap quest to reconstruct it from memory. This quest becomes a deep dive into the absurd, with themes of race, gender, sexuality, and the nature of human folly weaving through the narrative.

"Antkind" is replete with cultural allusions, from Beckett to Pynchon, and is laden with Kaufman's trademark blend of humor and existential dread. The novel tackles heavy themes like the critique of comedy and the need for empathy in a world rife with laughable absurdities. B.'s journey is one of self-discovery, confronting his own pretensions and the ludicrousness of the human condition

Kirkus Reviews describes "Antkind" as a splendid, spectacular mess, mirroring the ingenuity and narrative dazzle found in Kaufman's films. The book is recognized as a masterwork of postmodern storytelling, where film, speculative fiction, and eccentricity collide in a wonderfully inventive yarn .

For fans of Kaufman's work or those interested in a deep, thought-provoking dive into the nature of creativity and perception, "Antkind" is a rewarding, albeit challenging, read. Its narrative complexity and eccentricity make it a unique addition to the landscape of modern literature.

Kirkus Reviews characterizes "Empire of Things" as a masterly work, best suited for those deeply engaged in the study of marketing, underscoring its dense and detailed nature that may not be as accessible to a casual reader. Despite its complexity, the book has garnered acclaim for its in-depth exploration of the roots and ramifications of consumerism.

"Empire of Things" is not just a historical account; it is a reflection on our material world, exploring how our relentless pursuit of more has shaped societies, economies, and environments worldwide. Trentmann's work invites readers to consider the global challenges of our consumption patterns, from waste and debt to stress and inequality.

# Big Compute: The Future of Computational Power

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/BVSXv9f/big-compute-illustration.jpg" alt="Big Compute Illustration" />

In our journey through the age of information, we have witnessed the exponential growth of computational power. This article introduces a novel way to measure this growth: the concept of "people of compute," and explores how this metric can help us understand the rapid advancements in computing capabilities.

From the era of the "rack person" to the training of massive AI models like LLaMA and GPT-4, we'll delve into the fascinating world of high-performance computing and its implications for the future of technology and society.

### The Era of the Rack Person

We define one person of compute as equivalent to 20 PFLOPS, achievable with 64 A100s or a densely packed 42U A100 rack. Today, we stand at the dawn of the rack person era, where a single rack consumes approximately 30kW to deliver those 20 PFLOPS.

### Training Giants: LLaMA and GPT-4

LLaMA, trained on a cluster of 2048 A100 GPUs each boasting ~312 TFLOPS, represents a total of 639 PFLOPS or 32 people of compute. It required about 1 million GPU hours for its training, translating to 500 hours or roughly 3 weeks of continuous computation. This effort equates to approximately 2 person-years of compute work, while GPT-4 demanded an astonishing 100 person-years.

This scale of computation, while massive, remains within the realm of human comprehension. As long as this scale persists, especially over the next decade, the unit of a "person of compute" remains a valuable metric.

### The Pace of Progress

Reflecting on Moore's Law, we measure the advancement of computing not just in speed but in terms of how far we leap beyond the capabilities of a modern desktop, pegged at ~50 TFLOPS. This comparison helps us appreciate the strides we're making, with NVIDIA's GPUs showing significant progress:

- 1080 (2016) = 11.3 TFLOPS
- 2080 (2018) = 14.2 TFLOPS
- 3090 (2020) = 35.6 TFLOPS
- 4090 (2022) = 82.6 TFLOPS

Despite the 4090's high power consumption, we're maintaining a pace of doubling performance roughly every two years.

### The Cost of Compute

The financial aspect of compute power has also seen dramatic shifts. Today, a person of compute costs about $250k. By this metric, Google's 9 exaflop (450 person) computer is a leap into the future, embodying a computational capacity 24 years ahead of its time.

### Towards a Tampa of Compute

Extrapolating these trends, we can imagine building a computer with the power of 400,000 people - equivalent to a "Tampa" of compute - at the cost of the International Space Station (ISS), roughly $100B. This leads to the thought-provoking projection that, within a few decades, the computing power equating to "One Humanity" - or 20,000 Tampas - could be achievable for the price of the ISS.

### The Path Forward

As we project these trends into the future, the potential for computational growth seems boundless. Within a few decades, the power of a Humanity could sit on our desktops, revolutionizing every aspect of our lives from science and medicine to AI and beyond.

_This contemplation of computing's future is not just an exercise in numbers but a window into the potential transformations in our society. It underscores the importance of technological advancement, ethical considerations, and the profound impact on humanity's trajectory._

PredictiveChat introduces an innovative approach to leveraging large language models (LLMs) to anticipate user input, enabling instantaneous response generation in conversational AI systems. By predicting user messages and pre-generating responses, PredictiveChat aims to significantly enhance user experience through reduced response times. This paper outlines the system’s methodology, contrasts it with existing technologies, discusses its implementation, and explores potential future applications.

[GitHub](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/predictivechat) | [Original X/Twitter Thread](https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima/status/1762313302863200658)

## 1. Introduction

Conversational AI interfaces often suffer from latency, which can detract from the naturalness of human-computer interaction. PredictiveChat addresses this challenge by emulating the human ability to predict and formulate responses during conversation, aiming to achieve “negative latency” in certain instances and almost zero latency in others. This system not only seeks to reduce wait times but also leverages the additional processing time for more thoughtful and contextually relevant responses.

<a href="https://ibb.co/typing"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/typing" alt="typing" border="0"></a>


Example input: “When are the next Olympics being held?” cuts off the user message and answers correctly.

## 2. Background and Related Work

### 2.1 Predictive Technologies in Conversational AI

Existing technologies like Google’s Smart Reply and Apple’s QuickType have introduced predictive text and response capabilities, but they primarily focus on static predictions. In contrast, PredictiveChat dynamically anticipates the user’s complete input in real-time, offering a significant advancement over these earlier approaches.

### 2.2 Innovations in Latency Reduction

Twitter discussions highlighted several theoretical approaches and practical implementations relevant to PredictiveChat’s goals:

- **Vector Store and Violation of Expectation:** Inspired by @BloomBotAI, PredictiveChat utilizes vector stores as a cache mechanism, leveraging the psychological principle of “violation of expectation” to reduce latency.

- **Chain of Thought Processing:** PredictiveChat plans to use extra compute time for deeper processing, such as Chain-of-Thought or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), enhancing AI interaction models.

These discussions underscore the community’s interest in leveraging LLMs for predictive conversational AI, offering insights into potential improvements and innovations.

<a href="https://ibb.co/predictive chat overview"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/predictive chat overview" alt="predictive chat overview" border="0"></a>

## 3. System Architecture and Implementation

PredictiveChat is built on a Flask web application framework and integrates with OpenAI’s GPT models for input prediction and response generation. Its architecture features three key components:

- **Input Prediction Module:** Utilizes partial user inputs to predict the remainder of the user’s intended message, leveraging a custom adaptation of GPT-3.5 for dynamic prediction.
- **Response Generation Module:** Generates potential responses based on both partial and predicted inputs, facilitating instantaneous or near-instantaneous replies once the user completes their message.
- **Caching and Retrieval System:** Employs a vector-based mechanism to store message and response embeddings, allowing for rapid retrieval of similar past interactions to further reduce response times.

## 4. Data Flow and Processing

PredictiveChat’s innovative data flow begins with the user’s initial input, which is used to predict the message’s completion and generate a response preemptively. This approach has demonstrated the potential for “negative latency” in cases where the system accurately anticipates the user’s complete message, as well as almost zero latency when utilizing cached responses.

## 5. Evaluation and Insights from X/Twitter Discussion

While formal evaluation metrics and user studies are pending, initial observations suggest that PredictiveChat can achieve significant reductions in response latency. The Twitter discussion provided valuable insights into practical and theoretical innovations, highlighting the system’s potential to revolutionize conversational AI with features like:

- **Speculative Decoding:** Speeding up inference in LLMs by decoding future inputs preemptively.
- **Filler Words and Stalling Phrases:** Enhancing naturalness in AI interactions by incorporating filler words during processing times.
- **Speech-to-Speech Models:** Expanding PredictiveChat to direct speech-to-speech interactions, eliminating the need for text intermediaries.

## 6. Future Directions

PredictiveChat’s future opportunities include integrating Chain-of-Thought processing and/or RAG in a chat context, and exploring the potential for preemptive actions beyond chat, such as in user need prediction and robotics. The pattern could also investigate multimodal predictions to enrich interactions across different sensory inputs.

## 7. Conclusion

PredictiveChat offers a novel solution to the longstanding issue of latency in conversational AI. By predicting user inputs and leveraging advanced LLMs, the system promises a significant leap towards more natural and efficient human-computer interactions. Future enhancements, informed by ongoing discussions and technological advancements, will continue to refine and expand PredictiveChat’s capabilities.

Join us as we uncover the intricate processes behind AI-generated art and witness the beautiful results of merging technology with creativity.

Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models stand at the forefront of the intersection between artificial intelligence and art, leading a transformative journey into the realms of creativity previously uncharted by machines. This exploration delves into the mechanics of these models, their application in generating art akin to the works produced by Midjourney, and culminates in the creation of captivating gradient images.

## **Understanding the Mechanics**

### **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):**

At the heart of GANs lies a duel between two neural networks—the generator and the discriminator. The generator strives to create data mimicking a genuine dataset, while the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of this generated data against the real deal. This ongoing battle drives the generator towards producing increasingly realistic data, blurring the lines between artificial and genuine.

### **Diffusion Models:**

Diffusion models present a different approach to generative art, starting with a state of pure noise and gradually learning to sculpt this chaos into structured images. This process involves two key stages: the forward process, where noise is incrementally added to data, and the reverse process, where the model learns to revert noise-infused data back to its original or newly generated form.

## **Application in Art Generation**

Platforms like Midjourney leverage variations of these models to produce art that resonates with human aesthetic sensibilities. By training on extensive datasets of images, these models learn to generate new artworks that, while inspired by the dataset, are unique in their creation.

## **Developing and Programming a GAN Model:**

The development of a GAN model for art generation is a meticulous process that involves:

1. **Model Architecture Selection:** Choosing the right architecture for the generator and discriminator is crucial, as it determines the model's efficiency in learning and generating realistic images.

2. **Dataset Preparation:** A diverse and comprehensive dataset is foundational, as the quality and variety of data directly influence the model's output.

3. **Training:** The adversarial training process requires careful monitoring to ensure that neither the generator nor the discriminator becomes too powerful too quickly, maintaining a balance that fosters learning.

4. **Iteration and Optimization:** Continuous evaluation and tweaking of the model's parameters are essential for refining the generated outputs.

## **Generating Gradient Images:**

The culmination of this journey is the application of these models to generate a series of gradient images, showcasing the nuanced capabilities of GANs and diffusion models in creating art. Each image represents a unique point in the model's learning process, reflecting the subtle interplay of noise and structure that characterizes generative art.

From randomness and rule-based systems to AI-driven creations, we'll examine the diverse landscape of generative art and its impact on our understanding of artistic expression in the digital age.

# What is Generative Art?

Art can possess generative qualities, either by design or incidentally. Such qualities showcase the myriad interpretations of what it means for art to be generative.

I favor definitions that encourage exploration and discussion of generative art rather than strictly delineating what it is or isn't.

## Tentative Definitions

Consider:

**Generative Art**: Art produced through self-sustaining processes.

To clarify, an autonomous process is:

**Autonomous Process**: A process that operates independently from direct human manipulation.

## Structuring the Discussion

I propose dividing autonomous processes into randomness, systematic rules, and natural systems. This piece aims to explore these facets, providing examples of their utilization in generative art.

While this classification may have its shortcomings, including overlaps and exceptions, it serves as a guide to understanding the nuances of autonomy in art and the exploration of generativity.

## The Essence of Generation

At its core, generative art often relies on randomness.

An artist's algorithm might yield varied outcomes based on the configuration of certain variables, such as the quantity and placement of shapes, their sizes, and colors.

Below, (work-in-progress) visuals illustrate how variables govern the arrangement and connectivity of nodes, influencing the aesthetic of the connections.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/public../public/images/what-is-generative-art/bw_simple_1.png" alt="bw_simple_1" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
    <img src="/public..https://i.ibb.co/0C9bjTL/bw-simple-2.png" alt="bw_simple_2" style={{ width: '100%' }} />
  </div>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/public..https://i.ibb.co/D8gCLgv/bw-simple-3.png" alt="bw_simple_3" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />
    <img src="/public..https://i.ibb.co/353Lvnh/bw-simple-4.png" alt="bw_simple_4" style={{ width: '100%' }} />
  </div>
</div>

Indeed, we _could_ define variable values in the code or adjust them via sliders, which would signify a direct human-controlled, non-autonomous method. This is particularly cumbersome for defining characteristics for a large number of nodes, diverging from the core principles of generative art.

Instead, embracing true _generative_ art involves employing functions like `random()` to facilitate the generation of varied imagery with each execution, thus producing diverse results.

Vera Molnar, a pioneer in generative art, extensively incorporated randomness into her work. Viewing [this clip](https://vimeo.com/372579247) of her discussing her methodology is highly inspirational.

*Vera Molnar's discussion on generative art.*

## Pseudorandomness

An important distinction, both conceptually and technically, is the shift from genuine randomness to pseudorandomness.

The nature of computers precludes them from generating truly random numbers. Nevertheless, artists can simulate randomness satisfactorily for creative purposes using pseudorandom number generators (prng).

A prng initiates with a "seed" and applies an algorithm to generate a number. The seed is often derived from a changeable factor, like the computer's current timestamp.

Utilizing the algorithm with numerous unique seeds aims to produce a uniform distribution of numbers. This principle is illustrated in a p5js example that distributes 10,000 squares across a canvas, their placements determined by the `random()` function.

<a href="https://ibb.co/func_ran.png"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/func_ran.png" alt="func_ran.png" border="0"></a>
*Uniform distribution of squares via the `random()` function.*

The seed can be static for purposes such as testing or achieving repeatable results. In the realm of NFTs, platforms like [fxhash](https://www.fxhash.xyz/u/Amy%20Goodchild) and [ArtBlocks](https://artblocks.io/) utilize a blockchain transaction hash as the seed, ensuring consistency in the randomness.

Using the same seed invariably yields identical outcomes, rendering the process deterministic, not truly random.

## True Randomness

Certain fields, such as banking and cryptography, necessitate truly random numbers. These can be obtained from chaotic natural phenomena, like [atmospheric noise](https://www.random.org/) or the visual dynamics of [lava lamps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavarand).
<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>

  </div>
</div>

Exploring truly random numbers in generative art raises intriguing questions about the impact of randomness versus pseudorandomness on the artistic outcome. Does the nature of the number source alter the art significantly?

## A Philosophical Interlude

While a pseudorandom number generator is deterministic and predictable, natural sources of numbers are inherently chaotic and unpredictable.

However, this unpredictability presupposes a non-deterministic universe. If our universe is deterministic, where every event is the result of preceding ones, then true randomness might not exist. Quantum mechanics complicates this by demonstrating behaviors in subatomic particles that appear genuinely random and without cause. The debate on [determinism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) continues without consensus.

I intend to explore these themes further in upcoming blogs, as they unravel fascinating conceptual strands.

At present, we can assert that sources like atmospheric noise are unpredictable in practical terms, and [quantum](https://phys.org/news/2021-01-unpredictable-nature-quantum-mechanics-random.html) [random](https://qrng.anu.edu.au/) [number](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-95388-7) [generators](https://www.wired.com/story/quantum-mechanics-could-solve-cryptographys-random-number-problem/) may indeed be unpredictable on a theoretical level.

## Distribution

While a good prng should offer an even distribution of outcomes, artistic applications sometimes benefit from manipulating these results towards an uneven distribution.

[This sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/iverfinne/full/Ct8VRU1wZ) I crafted showcases this concept, using functions from [easings.net](https://easings.net/) intended for animation purposes.

  </div>
</div>

## Alternative Algorithms

Aside from pseudorandom number generators, procedural generation techniques like Perlin noise offer a different approach. Where a prng delivers evenly distributed yet unrelated outcomes, Perlin noise ensures a sequential similarity among results.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>

  </div>
</div>

Noise proves invaluable for generating organic-looking movements and shapes. Here are two pieces from Amy Goodchild's [Genuary 2022](https://genuary.art/) series, which rely on noise to determine variable values.

## Reflecting on Randomness

The philosophical inquiries surrounding randomness are profound, offering a rich field for conceptual exploration.

Aside from these theoretical considerations, tools like pseudorandomness and procedural generators, such as Perlin noise, provide accessible yet powerful means to achieve diverse and compelling results.

## Artistic Instructions

Sol LeWitt's artworks serve as quintessential examples of rule-based art. Some of his works are essentially sets of instructions rather than the physical realizations of those directives.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/public../public/images/what-is-generative-art/sol_lewitt_wall_drawing.png" alt="Sol LeWitt - Wall Drawing #118" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />

LeWitt's instructions have been realized multiple times, showcasing the interpretive flexibility and collaborative nature of executing such works.

    <p>Sol LeWitt drawing being made at Dia Beacon</p>
  </div>
</div>

The instructions offer a blend of specificity and openness, allowing for interpretation and variation by those who bring them to life, whether human or machine. This dynamic mirrors the distribution of control seen in many generative art projects, where the artist shares creative agency with the algorithms and the execution medium.

## Instructional Experiments

In Studio Moniker's project [_Red Follows Yellow Follows Blue Follows Red_](https://studiomoniker.com/projects/red-follows-yellow-follows-blue-follows-red), participants adorned in colored capes and headphones are guided by specific instructions. For example, those in red might be directed to "follow yellow but avoid blue," whereas those in blue are advised "follow red but avoid yellow."

This human-centric experiment highlights the nuanced balance between artist intent and participant interpretation, as individuals navigate the instructions in varying degrees of fidelity, thereby altering the collective outcome and control dynamic.

As each participant acts on their individual directives, emergent patterns and behaviors arise, illustrating the collective impact of singular actions.

## Emergent Phenomena

When elements within a system are governed by individual rules and properties, unexpected and fascinating outcomes can emerge at a macro level.

Emergence is a prevalent phenomenon in nature, observable in the behaviors of ant colonies, bird flocks, weather patterns, and more. By defining rules for individual components, we can engineer our systems of emergence.

## Cellular Automata

Cellular automata, such as Conway's Game of Life and Wolfram's rules, epitomize emergent systems.

Conway's Game of Life is structured around a grid of cells, each designated as alive or dead initially (either randomly or based on a pattern). Each cell evaluates its eight neighbors to decide its next state, following a set of rules:

1.  A live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, mimicking underpopulation.
    
2.  A live cell with two or three live neighbors persists through to the next cycle.
    
3.  A live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, reflecting overpopulation.
    
4.  A dead cell with exactly three live neighbors revives, simulating reproduction.
    
These dynamics generate complex patterns across the grid, influenced by the initial configuration.

These systems can be enriched and complicated by varying the number of potential states, modifying the neighborhood size and shape, and experimenting with different sets of rules. Systems that cycle through a sequence of states, like 0, 1, 2, 3, 0, 1, 2…, are known as Cyclic Cellular Automata.

## Dynamic Ecosystems

Moving beyond static grids, we can create complex emergent systems featuring mobile entities, each adhering to its set of behaviors inspired by natural phenomena such as flocking, mating, feeding, and mortality.

Here are examples of systems I've developed, showcasing behaviors like flocking, evasion, reproduction, repulsion, and predation.

These entities exhibit group movement and generate auditory signals when in close proximity.

Exploring the interplay and dependencies within such ecosystems offers profound insights. Incorporating life cycles, resource requirements, and predator-prey dynamics allows for the observation of an ecosystem's rise or decline.

## Simulating Natural Phenomena

Artists frequently emulate natural phenomena through algorithms reflecting principles such as reaction-diffusion, diffusion-limited aggregation, physical forces, crystalline growth, arboreal development, and slime mold behaviors.

Simulating complex real-world systems and phenomena involves modeling the rules that govern their constituent parts and the influencing variables.

These simulations span a spectrum of abstraction, bridging art and science. Some works draw loose inspiration from natural occurrences, while others aim to closely replicate and investigate the tangible world.

Consider these two representations of snowflakes. The first set of images showcases outputs from [Snowflaker](https://www.misha.studio/snowflaker/), generating aesthetically pleasing snowflake SVGs. The second set features [Gravner-Griffeath](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/sa-visual/in-silico-flurries/) snowflakes (interactive example [here](https://cruzgodar.com/applets/gravner-griffeath-snowflakes/gravner-griffeath-snowflakes.html)), produced by accurately simulating crystal growth under varying conditions.

## Cultivating Art

Magical Contamination by Antoine Bridier-Nahmias turns petri dishes into canvases for microbial growth. Echoing the approach used in Gravner-Griffeath's snowflakes, the artist manipulates conditions such as oxygen levels, lighting, and temperature to influence mold development.

This initiative highlights the distinction between simulated environments and the unpredictability of the real world, though it could be argued that the "simulation" we perceive as reality is equally chaotic and complex.

## Mathematics in Motion

Mathematics underpins many rule-based systems, with geometry and trigonometry being particularly indispensable for my work. The frequent appearance of SOHCAHTOA serves as a constant reminder of the beauty and utility of mathematics in art.

Dave Whyte's works exemplify the elegance of mathematical principles in visual art.

For those interested in delving deeper into the intersection of mathematics and art, I recommend this insightful book on the subject.

## Conceptualizing Algorithms

Occasionally, ideas manifest as a series of "what ifs," essentially forming the blueprint of an algorithm—a sequence of steps to be followed.

Casey Reas' pen-plotted series [_RGB-3_](https://reas.com/rgb_3/) illustrates this concept perfectly. The angles mentioned in the titles refer to the orientations of red, green, and blue lines within the compositions. Selective omission of line segments creates unique overlay effects.

## Reflecting on Rule-Based Creativity

This exploration merely scratches the surface of what's possible within the realm of rule-based generation.

Key takeaways from this journey include the diverse methodologies for establishing and applying rules, and the profound impact of individual rules on emergent system-level phenomena.

# Expanding the Canvas

As highlighted earlier, the realms of generative art encompass a vast array of overlaps and omissions. Here, we'll explore some facets previously unaddressed.

## Data as a Muse

While we've touched on chaotic data sources for generating true randomness, employing structured data sources presents another avenue of exploration.

Certain works in this genre seamlessly blend with data visualization, such as Aaron Koblin's [_Flight Patterns_](http://www.aaronkoblin.com/project/flight-patterns/), which maps air traffic patterns across North America. Conversely, Maria Takeuchi and Frederico Phillips' [_Asphyxia_](http://www.asphyxia-project.com/) utilizes a Kinect to capture dancer Shiho Tanaka's movements, transforming them into a 3D rendered form. Though representational, the output diverges from traditional data visualization techniques.

  </div>
</div>

"Data source" can also imply a direct analog translation to output, as seen in Charles Sowers' [_Windswept_](https://www.charlessowers.com/new-page-1), where wind-driven metal arrows create visual patterns reminiscent of Vera Molnar's Interruptions, blurring the lines between data representation and artistic expression.

## The AI Intersection

Art leveraging machine learning occupies a distinct yet parallel lane to generative art. Despite the apparent differences, outputs from AI-driven processes are intrinsically generative. A machine learning algorithm, rooted in a complex rule system, could theoretically be discussed within the Rules section, though the unique characteristics of ML/AI art warrant its own classification.

Machine learning algorithms depend on datasets for training. Anna Ridler's [_Myriad (Tulips)_](http://annaridler.com/myriad-tulips) exemplifies this, with Ridler manually compiling a dataset of 10,000 tulip photographs. Later, in [_Mosaic Virus_](http://annaridler.com/mosaic-virus), she employs a GAN (generative adversarial network) trained on this dataset to generate novel tulip images, highlighting the nuanced interplay between artist control and algorithmic autonomy.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
  <div style={{ width: '50%', padding: '5px' }}>
    <img src="/public../public/images/what-is-generative-art/myriad_tulips.jpg" alt="Myriad (Tulips) (2018) - Anna Ridler" style={{ width: '100%', marginBottom: '10px' }} />

    <p>Mosaic Virus (2019) - Anna Ridler</p>
  </div>
</div>

In many scenarios, a data source acts as a byproduct of another process—naturally occurring information awaiting capture and organization. When considering the creative output's control dynamics, the data source largely falls outside the artist's purview, while manipulation and application of that data remain under their influence.

Ridler's project diverges, as she exercises considerable control over the dataset, entrusting the generative outcomes to the GAN's internal mechanisms.

## Surrealist Automatism

Surrealists employed automatic drawing as a means for the artist's subconscious to manifest, allowing the hand to move "randomly" across the canvas. For early abstract artist Hilma Af Klint, this technique facilitated communication with the spirit realm during séances.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>

  </div>
</div>

Generative art, as previously defined, is characterized by its creation outside of direct human control, potentially stretching the definition to include automatism. However, if accessing the subconscious (or the spirit world) falls outside of conscious control, then such works might fit within the generative art paradigm.

Considering the balance of control inherent in many generative artworks—between the artist and the algorithm, or the artist and the participant—the relationship between the artist and their own subconscious may be viewed similarly. When ideas emerge, their origins can be as enigmatic and chaotic as the weather, suggesting a deeper interconnection between consciousness, creativity, and randomness.

<div style={{ display: 'flex', flexWrap: 'wrap', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>

  </div>
</div>

Some automatists fully surrendered to their subconscious, crafting entire works under its guidance, while others used automatism as a starting point, later steering the work towards more structured or figurative expressions. [Automatism](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/art-terms/a/automatism) paved the way for techniques that introduced chance and spontaneity into artistic creation, including collage, frottage (pencil rubbings), and grattage (paint scraping), further blurring the lines between conscious control and random influence.

This transition segues into the concluding discussion:

## The Spectrum of Painting and Drawing

I posited that traditional painting could be viewed through a generative lens, particularly when automatism influences the creative process or when the act of painting itself incorporates elements of randomness.

[Jackson Pollock](https://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/jackson-pollock-1785)'s action paintings epitomize this blend of automatism and chance. His methodology, devoid of a predefined plan, allowed the artwork to evolve from the painting process itself, relinquishing control to the spontaneity of the moment. The lively, unrestrained nature of his drip technique underscores the presence of natural phenomena, such as fluid dynamics, introducing randomness into the artwork.

  </div>
</div>

Rather than categorizing paintings as either generative or not, a more nuanced approach views this characteristic as a continuum. Some artworks are tightly controlled by the artist, others heavily influenced by chance, with many residing in the intermediate space. The artist's intent and perspective also critically influence whether their work is perceived as generative.

## Conclusion

Generative art, while often associated with digital mediums like p5js sketches, Vera Molnar's plotter drawings, and flow fields, reveals a deeper, broader canvas upon closer examination. This exploration, although extensive, likely overlooks additional dimensions and perspectives within the generative art landscape.

The interplay of categories discussed herein highlights the fluidity and potential for crossover, suggesting untapped avenues for artistic exploration and creation.

The conceptual landscape of generative art—pondering the delineations between chance and deterministic outcomes, the origins of creativity and randomness, the manifestations of generativity in nature, and the philosophical inquiries surrounding simulation and reality—offers a rich territory for inquiry.

Generative art is far from a nascent genre, yet its current renaissance hints at the infancy of its exploration. Anticipating and contributing to the evolution of this field, I remain eager to witness and engage with works that navigate these complex themes and questions, enriching the tapestry of generative art.
