## About Ex Libris

Ex libris, Latin for "from the books of," are small printed labels or stamps placed in books to indicate ownership. These designs often incorporate elements that are meaningful to the book owner, such as:

- Symbols representing their profession or hobbies
- Favorite quotes or mottos
- Family crests or personal emblems
- Artistic representations of their name

The collection presented here demonstrates a range of styles and approaches to creating these unique personal identifiers, showcasing the intersection of graphic design, personal expression, and the love of books.
