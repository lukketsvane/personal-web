Adrian Tchaikovsky's "Children of Time" isn't just another sci-fi book. It's a deep dive into evolution, AI, and what it means to be alive. Won the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 2016, and for good reason.

Here's the deal: We've got a terraformed planet, genetically modified spiders (yeah, spiders), and an AI running the show based on a human's brain. Sounds crazy? It is, but it's brilliantly executed.

The book flips between spiders evolving into a society (think about that for a second) and humans looking for a new crib in the galaxy. It’s about intelligence—what it looks like across species—and the moral gymnastics of playing god.

Tchaikovsky nails it with the spider civilization. It's alien, sure, but damn if you don't start rooting for them. The storytelling’s tight, cutting between our future and theirs, making you question who’s more humane.

What's really killer here is the dual perspective. It's not just humans vs. spiders; it's a mirror reflecting our own societal and evolutionary quirks. Makes you think, doesn’t it?

"Children of Time" is a sharp look at evolution's wild possibilities, wrapped in a narrative that punches above its weight in sci-fi. With a cover that’s as dark and intriguing as space itself, it's a solid 8/10. A must-read if you’re into evolution, AI, or just good ol’ thinking.
