Adrian Tchaikovsky's "Children of Time" isn't just another sci-fi book. It's a deep dive into evolution, AI, and what it means to be alive. Won the Arthur C. Clarke Award in 2016, and for good reason.

Here's the deal: We've got a terraformed planet, genetically modified spiders (yeah, spiders), and an AI running the show based on a human's brain. Sounds crazy? It is, but it's brilliantly executed.

The book flips between spiders evolving into a society (think about that for a second) and humans looking for a new crib in the galaxy. It’s about intelligence—what it looks like across species—and the moral gymnastics of playing god.

Tchaikovsky nails it with the spider civilization. It's alien, sure, but damn if you don't start rooting for them. The storytelling’s tight, cutting between our future and theirs, making you question who’s more humane.

What's really killer here is the dual perspective. It's not just humans vs. spiders; it's a mirror reflecting our own societal and evolutionary quirks. Makes you think, doesn’t it?

"Children of Time" is a sharp look at evolution's wild possibilities, wrapped in a narrative that punches above its weight in sci-fi. With a cover that’s as dark and intriguing as space itself, it's a solid 8/10. A must-read if you’re into evolution, AI, or just good ol’ thinking.

An interesting new theory for thinking about how brain systems operate at a high-level. Hawkins argues for the significance of independent cortical-columns in the brain as individual functional units to synthesize information.

The theory seems plausible but unlikely to capture the full picture, which can describe most theories.

I wish the book went into more technical detail on the theory itself and it's implications, but instead only the first third of the book is dedicated to it.

The next two-thirds of the book are Hawkins talking about his theories on AI and the future of humanity, which are unrelated and also a bit incongruous.

Cixin Liu's "The Three-Body Problem" isn’t just sci-fi; it’s a brain-bending mix of history, science, and first contact, all rolled into one. Ken Liu's translation nails it, making complex concepts and a foreign setting accessible.

The story kicks off during China's Cultural Revolution, showing us how Ye Wenjie sees her world and family torn apart. Fast forward, and she's inadvertently inviting an alien race, the Trisolarans, to Earth. These aliens come from a planet with three suns, which means life there is anything but stable. 

Liu isn't just spinning a yarn about aliens. He’s talking about survival in chaos, the lengths societies go to endure, and what happens when humanity realizes it's not alone—or even top dog. The Trisolarans are a mirror, showing us the best and worst of human nature.

Yeah, the science is tight—Liu doesn’t skimp on the physics or the big questions about the universe. But it’s the human story that grabs you. Ye Wenjie's journey from loss to radical action is the heart of this tale, set against humanity’s own existential crisis.

This book is a thinker. It asks big questions: Can humanity get its act together? What does it mean to be civilized? It’s ambitious, blending real science with speculative fiction, and it doesn’t shy away from the dark side of human nature.

Ken Liu’s translation is key, bridging cultural gaps and making the story resonate no matter where you're from. Plus, the footnotes are gold, offering insights into the Chinese context of the story.

With a cool cover and a story that spans the cosmos, "The Three-Body Problem" is a solid 7/10. It’s dense, sure, but stick with it. This book’s got something to say about where we’re headed, and it’s worth listening.

title: "Antkind: A Novel"
author: "Charlie Kaufman"

rating: 4

Charlie Kaufman's debut novel, "Antkind," presents a sprawling narrative that is both hilariously surreal and deeply introspective. This novel encapsulates the signature quirkiness and existential rumination that fans of Kaufman's films like "Being John Malkovich" and "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" have come to expect. With a hefty page count of 720, the story is a maximalist exploration of identity, memory, and the very fabric of reality.

The protagonist, B. Rosenberger Rosenberg, is a neurotic and underappreciated film critic who stumbles upon a potentially earth-shattering three-month-long stop-motion film created by Ingo Cutbirth. The film, which is later lost to a tragic fire, sends B. on a madcap quest to reconstruct it from memory. This quest becomes a deep dive into the absurd, with themes of race, gender, sexuality, and the nature of human folly weaving through the narrative.

"Antkind" is replete with cultural allusions, from Beckett to Pynchon, and is laden with Kaufman's trademark blend of humor and existential dread. The novel tackles heavy themes like the critique of comedy and the need for empathy in a world rife with laughable absurdities. B.'s journey is one of self-discovery, confronting his own pretensions and the ludicrousness of the human condition

Kirkus Reviews describes "Antkind" as a splendid, spectacular mess, mirroring the ingenuity and narrative dazzle found in Kaufman's films. The book is recognized as a masterwork of postmodern storytelling, where film, speculative fiction, and eccentricity collide in a wonderfully inventive yarn .

For fans of Kaufman's work or those interested in a deep, thought-provoking dive into the nature of creativity and perception, "Antkind" is a rewarding, albeit challenging, read. Its narrative complexity and eccentricity make it a unique addition to the landscape of modern literature.
